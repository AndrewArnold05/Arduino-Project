# Arduino-Project
An Arduino-based project integrating an LCD display, stepper motor, RFID authentication, and IR remote control. The system demonstrates secure access with RFID, real-time feedback on an LCD screen, and additional functionality via an IR sensor and remote.


Features

RFID Authentication – Grants access only with a valid RFID tag/card.
LCD Display – Provides real-time feedback and system status.
Stepper Motor Control – The physical actuator that responds to system input.
IR Sensor + Remote – Allows remote input for added control and functionality.
Modular Design – Easy to expand with additional sensors or outputs.
